  <p class="u--noMargin">
    I am a UX Developer in Chicago with a passion for design, usability and inclusivity.
  </p>
  <p>
    I feel that we have a responsibility as software developers to build products that do no harm.
  </p>
  
  I love:
  <ul>
    <li>
      building delightful, intuitive user interfaces and scalable, maintainable visual systems (and <a href="">speaking</a> about these things!)
    </li>
    <li>
      traveling, learning to cook and painting
    </li>
    <li>
      lava lamps, space 🌌and cats 🐱
    </li>
  </ul>
